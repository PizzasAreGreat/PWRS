# PWRS
The PWRS (or Pressurized Water Reactor Simulator) is a highly realistic nuclear reactor simulator coded in python that allows the user to have control over the widest range of the reactor's features.
This project was originally created by me and my friend. That's why some content might be in French (we would be very grateful if you could leave it that way).
We have created this project because there is no realistic and free nuclear power plant simulator on the internet, 
so the idea of this repo is to create one and make it available to the public.
Regarding our commit and PR policy, we welcom any translation of the software, since the current one is a bad mix of english and french.
