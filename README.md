# PWRS
The PWRS (or Pressurized Water Reactor Simulator) is a highly realistic nuclear reator simulator coded in python that allows the user to have control over the widest range of the reactor's features.
This project was originally created by me and my friend. That's why some content might be in French (we would be very grateful if you could leave it that way).
We have created this project because there is no realistic and free nuclear power plant simulator on the internet, 
so the idea of this repo is to create one and make it available to the public.
Regarding our commit and PR policy, we welcom any translation of the software, since the currentone is a bad mix of englush and french.
I still haven't find any really satisfying lincence for this project (if you have any suggestions, feel free), in the duration, 
please don't use this fact as a loophole to use the code for any usage that may not be "good". 
To come ahead of any problem, here's an expplicit statement about the way this code should be reused:
Any re-use of this code or part of this code , commercial or not, must be done with my exlpicit agreement.
